huffmanCoder
============

This is a java program which Huffman codes files on the byte level. Optimal compression is achieved on files with significant byte repitition, e.g text files.

This was made for an assignment intended to teach about trees. The initial assignment was focused around demonstration hence only required the huffman coding to be output as a String of ones and zeros. With the permission of the teacher I asked of I could take it one step further and output to file. In researching this project I relized examples of java bit manipulation are somewhat rare on the internet; as such, I've decided to make this little bit of code freely available.
