# huffmanCoder

This is a java program which can Huffman code and decode files on the byte level. Optimal compression is achieved on files with significant byte repitition, e.g text files.

This was made for an assignment intended to teach about trees. The initial assignment was focused around demonstration hence only required the huffman coding to be output as a String of ones and zeros. With the permission of the teacher I asked of I could take it one step further and output to file. In researching this project I relized examples of java bit manipulation are somewhat rare on the internet; as such, I've decided to make this little bit of code freely available.

# Json
### A JSON Parser

The the C# JSON parsers I know of are designed for populating objects with the JSON data. This can parse arbitrary arbitrary JSON into nested dictionaries and lists.

I made this as a way of refeshing my knowledge of C# and of finite state machines. I took shortcuts with the number and string parsing, so I don't know if those parts conform to the specification.
